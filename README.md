#NPTVGC - Nonparametric Time-Varying Granger Causality

This framework can be used to test for Granger Causality nonparametrically in time-varying conditions. 
We use exponentially weighted moving average density estimators. The test we use is the Diks Panchenko test (Diks, C. and Panchenko, V. (2006). A new statistic and practical guidelines for nonparametric
granger causality testing. Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, 30(9-10):1647â€“1669.)
